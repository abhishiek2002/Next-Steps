# üõ† Skills & Roadmap to Build a Generative AI Model

## Phase 1 ‚Äì Computer Science & Math Foundations
*(You need solid fundamentals before touching AI)*

- **Programming:** Python (AI standard), C++/Rust (for speed), JavaScript/TypeScript (for tools).  
- **Data Structures & Algorithms:** (you already started in C++ üëç).  
- **Operating Systems & Networking:** threads, memory management, sockets.  
- **Mathematics for AI** (deep understanding, not just formulas):
  - Linear Algebra (vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, SVD).  
  - Probability & Statistics.  
  - Calculus (gradients, optimization).  
  - Information Theory (entropy, KL divergence, cross-entropy).  

üìç **Outcome:** You should be able to implement matrix multiplication, backpropagation, and probability models from scratch.

  - Regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction.  
  - Overfitting, bias-variance tradeoff, regularization.  
- **Optimization:** Gradient descent, SGD, Adam, RMSProp.  
- **Model Evaluation:** Cross-validation, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC.  

üìç **Outcome:** Be able to train ML models (Scikit-learn, NumPy) and implement them manually.

  - n-grams ‚Üí RNNs ‚Üí Transformers ‚Üí GPT-like LLMs.  
- **Pretraining & Fine-tuning:** Self-supervised learning, causal language modeling, masked language modeling.  
- **Generative Models:**  
  - Variational Autoencoders (VAEs).  
  - GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks).  
  - Diffusion Models (Stable Diffusion).  
- **Scaling Laws:** Why bigger models = better, until compute/data bottleneck.  

üìç **Outcome:** Build a small GPT-like model and train it on a custom dataset.

## Phase 7 ‚Äì Deployment & Productization

- **MLOps:** Model serving, CI/CD for ML, monitoring drift.  
- **Scalable APIs:** FastAPI, gRPC, serverless infra.  
- **Vector Databases:** Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS (for embeddings).  
- **Privacy & Security:** Data governance, prompt injection defenses, watermarking.  
- **Open-source Contributions:** Hugging Face, LangChain, vLLM.  

üìç **Outcome:** Your model runs in production with APIs, like Perplexity or Gemini.

## üéØ Suggested Learning Path (Timeline)

- **Year 1:** Phase 1 & 2 (CS + ML basics).  
- **Year 2:** Phase 3 & 4 (Deep learning + GenAI fundamentals).  
- **Year 3:** Phase 5 & 6 (Infra + RLHF + RAG + scaling).  
- **Year 4 onward:** Phase 7 (Product + research-level improvements).  

‚ö° **Quick tip:** Along the way, reproduce research papers (like *Attention is All You Need*, *GPT-3*, *PaLM*, RLHF papers). This is the best way to gain deep understanding.
