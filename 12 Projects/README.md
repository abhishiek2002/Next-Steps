🔹 Beginner → Intermediate Projects

(These strengthen your fundamentals while being useful)

Markdown Editor 📝

Build a desktop/web editor where you can type Markdown and see live preview.

Use marked.js (for rendering) + a text area.

Add “export to PDF/HTML” feature.

🔑 Skill: Parsing + text processing.

JSON Viewer & Formatter 🔍

Input raw JSON → format, validate, and show collapsible tree view.

Add ability to search keys and values.

🔑 Skill: Working with structured data.

CLI Todo App ⌨️

Create a command-line tool with commands like todo add "task", todo list, todo done 1.

Store tasks in a JSON/SQLite file.

🔑 Skill: Command-line tools + file handling.

🔹 Intermediate → Advanced Projects

(Now getting closer to developer tools) 4. Mini Git 🧑‍💻

Recreate basic Git features:

init (create repo)

add (track changes)

commit (save snapshot)

log (view history)

🔑 Skill: File system management + versioning.

Custom Package Manager 📦

Like npm but simpler.

Allow installing JS packages from a registry (or GitHub repo).

Maintain a package.json equivalent.

🔑 Skill: Networking + dependency management.

Text Diff Tool ⚡

Compare two text files and highlight differences (like GitHub diffs).

Add line numbers + color-coded changes.

🔑 Skill: Algorithms (diff/longest common subsequence).

🔹 Advanced Projects (Big Leaps)

Custom Code Editor (your VS Code idea) 💻

We already discussed this.

🔑 Skill: Desktop dev + file system + advanced UI.

Mini Database Engine 🗄️

Implement a simple database that supports:

Creating tables

Inserting rows

Querying with simple SQL-like commands

🔑 Skill: Data structures + query parsing.

Build Your Own Shell 🖥️

Like bash or zsh.

Support commands (ls, cd, cat) and piping (|).

🔑 Skill: OS concepts + process handling.

Code Formatter / Linter ✨

Pick a language (say JavaScript).

Create a simple tool that:

Formats code (indentation, spaces).

Warns about unused variables.

🔑 Skill: AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) parsing + compiler basics.

🎯 My Recommendation for You (based on your skills now)

Since you already know Node.js, React, MongoDB, SQL, and frontend → start with:

Markdown Editor (desktop) → to get used to Electron.

CLI Todo App → to practice building developer tools.

Mini Git → to dive into deeper developer-focused projects.

Then jump to your VS Code–like editor.
